# Console.sorry()

This landscape-altering, paradigm-shifting library provides web developers a new way to express their inner-canadian wholesomeness. Apologize for your code, _in_ your code. It's as simple as:

```
console.sorry('I don\'t know why I did this, but I will do better. I promise.')
```

To use it, make sure you import the library with a script tag in your header. Then, `console.sorry` your way to forgiveness.
